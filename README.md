Code which uses Rvest and RSelenium to get Origin | Destination information (every schedule, price, trains, etc) from "Comboios de Portugal" website.

Retrieving information from the www.codigos-postais.pt website

In this code you may find two different ways to get information from the www.codigos-postais.pt website. The information I needed was the gps coordinates and street name of a list of postal codes. I've made two different approaches, one using "rvest" and another using "RSelenium".
